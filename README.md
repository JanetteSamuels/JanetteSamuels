# Hi, I'm Janette 👋

🎓 Junior Data Engineer |🛠 Python, SQL, AWS | 🧠 Law & Sociology Grad → Queen of the Cloud | 🌍 London

---

I'm a junior data engineer passionate about turning messy, fragmented data into structured systems that support better thinking, decision-making, and innovation. I bring curiosity, clarity, and care to everything I build; from ETL pipelines to cloud automation.

My background in law and sociology sharpened how I approach structure, logic, and systems. Now, I apply those skills through code; building tools that transform raw data into something meaningful, testable, and scalable.
